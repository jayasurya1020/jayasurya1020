👋 Hi, I’m Jayasurya S
👀 I’m interested in front-end development, specifically building dynamic and responsive web applications using Angular and TypeScript. I also enjoy working with Highcharts, ag-Grid, and Bryntum Scheduler to create complex data visualizations.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Angular features, optimizing performance for large-scale applications, and experimenting with state management solutions like NgRx.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Angular projects that involve data visualization, real-time dashboards, or interactive UI/UX. I'm also interested in contributing to open-source Angular libraries.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via my email: jayasurya1020@gmail.com, or connect with me on LinkedIn.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I love listening to Indian songs while coding, and I often experiment with CSS animations to bring web components to life!
